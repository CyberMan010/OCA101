# Welcome to Mohamad Hasoun's Private Repository

Welcome to my private repository, This repository is my digital diary for the **Orange Coding Academy** journey. Here, you'll find my projects, tasks, and resources neatly organized for easy exploration. Feel free to join me as I navigate through this coding adventure! Here's how this repository is organized for efficient use:

## What You'll Find:

### My Learning:

Explore my learning timeline and access tasks and assignments submitted during the bootcamp. The `learning-timeline.md` file provides an overview of my progress. Tasks and assignments are organized chronologically from May to October, allowing coaches to track my development over time.

### Projects:

Discover the projects I've been working on during the bootcamp. Each project folder contains source code in the `src` directory, along with a `README.md` file providing documentation and instructions.

### Side Projects:

Explore smaller side projects or experiments I've been working on alongside my main coursework. Each side project folder includes source code in the `src` directory and a `README.md` file with project details.

### Resources:

Access supplementary learning materials recommended by the academy. This includes lectures, tutorials, articles, and other resources to deepen understanding and master new concepts.
